If we want to insert an image on the website, we need to create a folder under the same R project folder and store the picture that we want to post in that newly created folder.                            
In this practice, I created a folder named `Images` and put the gif picture of Yier and Bubu into this folder. Then I can insert that gif picture on my website as the following:
